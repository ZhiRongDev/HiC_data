# CTCF notes

- CTCF is an insulator protein strongly enriched in TAD boundaries.

- CTCF is enriched near TAD boundaries, "near" is defined as +/- 20kb around the boundary (Dixon et.al. 2012)

- Considering linear genome, two convergent CTCF binding sites are very likely to outline a chromatin loop. 

- Cell type specificity of CTCF binding - "Widespread plasticity in CTCF occupancy linked to DNA methylation" [PMID: 22955980]

- The position frequency matrix of CTCF for human was downloaded from Jaspar 2016 (http://jaspar.genereg.net). CTCF motif occurrences were identified by the FIMO package (V4.11.1) with the P-value < 1e-5. In total, 110879 motif occurrences were identified.

High- and extreme occupancy target regions (TF binding) are also enriched. CTCF enrichment is general. See also [@Malik:2015aa]
